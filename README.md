# Burger

In this assignment , i've created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, ORM. 

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, my app will display the burger on the left side of the page  -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. 

My app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. 

See below the video of the app:
